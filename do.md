1 Introduction
1.1 Your project
Software development encompasses more than just coding. To name just a few elements, it 
involves gathering requirements, design, analysis, planning, identifying risks and 
communication. In this course, you are given a small software product development project 
that is split into multiple individual and group assessments spread over the duration of both 
semesters.
Your group assessment goal is not to build a complete solution to all the issues in the 
problem description. There are only twenty weeks of the course to operate in and you will 
have other course workloads to manage.
The goal for the assessment as a whole course is to gather requirements, design a system 
and build a prototype for a subset of the design to prove that the concept of your design 
works. 
Your design must cover an end-to-end solution, but your functional prototype should only 
focus on one or more key element(s) of this design. This could be an ingest pipeline, data 
visualisation, or something else you identify.
Please note that the goal of this assessment is to implement a prototype of the concept 
you have prioritised, and that you will be expected to be able to explain why your chosen 
element (or elements) has been implemented.
Your solution must include major elements of a software project, including (but not limited 
to):
• Design specifications.
• Different types and levels of testing.
• Interaction with your client(s).
• An assessment of the quality of your prototype and project team.
When undertaking this project, you are expected to:
• Follow good development practices.
• Justify and explain the decisions you make as part of the assessments. 
• Show ability to work individually as well as part of a team (i.e., team coordination).
• Show ability to communicate at both a technical level (i.e., with other software 
developers), and non-technical level (i.e., with clients).
4
1.2 Your client
Some members of the course assessment team will be acting as the clients for the purposes 
of this project. We strongly encourage you to contact the course assessment team if you 
have any questions or areas of confusion or want to discuss the details of the product 
requirements or design.
1.3 Your team
This course will be 80% group assessed and 20% individually assessed. 
The group assessment will include peer assessment which can modify the group mark for 
individuals.
Groups will be randomly assigned by the course administration and assessment team. 
Groups will by default have 4 people. There may be groups 3 or 5 depending on the number 
of people taking the course.
Groups will be assigned at the start of Week 1.
Other than the communication tool, which is detailed in the Resources section, groups are 
expected to determine how they will coordinate and communicate – there is no prescribed 
method set for this as it depends on the individuals and the dynamic between them. Note 
that on-campus students can utilise face to face meetings, but online collaboration and 
meetings are feasible to work with as well.
Any internal group problems should initially be handled within the group. If this proves to 
be insufficient, the problem should be escalated to the course organisers and student 
support team. This may result in a meeting with members of the course team and the 
project team. This is an opportunity to have issues resolved.
Please note that when peer assessment is being reviewed, any major issues referenced in 
feedback that have not previously been raised to the course team will result in the peer 
assessment being disregarded for that group.
1.3.1 Programme Manager
Another member of the course assessment team will be acting as the Programme Manager. 
This role ensures groups are on track by organising regular update meetings with one 
representative of each group and notifying groups of important deadlines.
All groups are expected to attend Group Management Meetings (GMMs).
5
All group members are expected to take turns representing your group at one or more 
GMMs, depending on the size of group (i.e., if your group has 3 members, one of you may 
have to attend 2 meetings).
You will have regular meetings with the Programme Manager, as detailed in the project 
timetable on Learn, but we strongly encourage you to contact the Programme Manager 
outside of these meetings as well if you have any questions or want to discuss about project 
management such as planning, risk management, and documentation.
1.3.2 Mentors
Each group will be assigned a mentor. This mentor will be a member of EPCC staff that will 
be available for the group to ask questions of and ask advice. The mentor will not be 
involved in marking of any groups work. They will be there as a source of experience. They 
will not make any decisions for the group nor carry out any assessed work for the group. 
They can be asked within reason to take part in any user testing.
You will have regular meetings with your mentor, as detailed in the project timetable on 
Learn, but we strongly encourage you to contact your mentor outside of these meetings as 
well if you are looking for advice and/or guidance.
1.4 Your assignments
This course has 4 assignments:
• An initial formative group assessment
• A summative group presentation
• One summative group assessment with two interim milestones and a final 
submission for one unified implementation of a prototype for the client
• An individual summative reflection and project review
Assignments will be marked out of 100 and then weighted as part of the final course mark 
out of 100. The assignment weightings are the following:
Assignment Weight out of the total course mark
Formative Group Assessment NA
Summative Group Presentation 10%
Milestone 1 NA
Milestone 2 NA
Summative Group Assessment 70%
Summative Personal Reflection 20%
The details of each assignment can be found in the Assessments section.

2 Resources
Once groups are assigned, each group will receive a notification on Learn containing the 
details of their GitLab project, Teams channel, and EIDF VM.
2.1 GitLab Project
Each group will have access to a GitLab project hosted on the University of Edinburgh ECDF 
GitLab service. Access to your group project will be provided to you by the course 
organisation team. 
Note: The owner of the project will be a member of EPCC. Do not try to restrict staff access 
to the project, otherwise your work will not be able to be assessed.
2.2 Teams Channel
Your group will be assigned a Teams channel that you are expected to use for the duration 
of the project. Here, you can communicate with your team members, course organisers, and 
mentors. 
This will not be closely monitored by the course organisers or mentors, and will not 
contribute to your marks, however, it is used as a record of your communications and team 
dynamics in case of any group disputes.
2.3 Prototype Code and Dataset
A repository containing prototype code, sample dataset and basic instructions has been 
provided.
Each group should clone this repository and push any changes or updates they want to 
make to their own repository from 0.
The repository is located at:
https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/epcc-msc-resources/software-development/assessments/paper￾analysis-group-assessment
This repository contains a basic README and dataset along with code to evaluate in the 
formative assessment.
7
2.4 EIDF Virtual Machine
Each group will be provided with a Virtual Machine accessible via SSH and VDI on the EIDF 
platform.
This virtual machine will be a development machine for your group to use and for hosting 
any prototype solutions that are created. These VMs will be left in place for the whole 
course and can be used to show running code.
Note: This is not a substitute for writing deployment instructions for your prototype. This is 
in addition – a facility to show a working prototype.
Note: Group VMs are not backed up – group code will be highly dependent on good use of 
version control in the event of a failure.
Note: Please DO NOT use cloud VMs instead of the provided VM. If you require more 
resources, please request this from the course organisers, providing a justification. 
2.4.1 Accessing EIDF
All students should ensure that they have a SAFE account before attempting to access EIDF.
To access EIDF resources, follow the guide provided here:
https://epcced.github.io/eidf-docs/access/project/
You will need to request to join the project EIDF-018 (EPCC MSc Courses).
After you have had your access request granted, you will be given access to your group VM.
This can be accessed via SSH and VDI:
https://epcced.github.io/eidf-docs/access/
Note: Members of groups will have sudo permissions on their respective VMs. Groups 
must adhere to the University computing regulations agreed to when they matriculated as a 
student:
https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/about/policies-and-regulations/computing￾regulations

3 Project Description
The client would like a system for the analysis of academic papers and other sources (e.g., 
news articles). The analysis options would encompass (but not be limited to):
• Authorship
• Sentiment
• Theme
• Topic
The solution should allow researchers and/or analysts to ingest academic and other source 
articles into a data store for running analysis queries targeting the information and 
metadata collated about the papers. Some examples of analysis queries could include (but 
not be limited to):
• Clusters of papers around topics
• Links between authors
• Links between topics
• Links between authors and topics
• Sentiment analysis
• Paper outcomes
• Retractions
• Paper reference networks
• Timeline
Please note the analysis is expected to include identifying how papers and/or articles are 
linked beyond just identifying common authors or referencing.
The solution should provide a method to enable different visualisations of the results, from 
textual to graphical, supporting interactive analysis and near-real-time query processing on 
the data store.
The solution components should support (but not limited to):
• Data ingest from different sources.
• Data storing in raw and analytics-ready form.
• Query layer.
• Visualisation system supporting multiple visualisation types.
Components which could be introduced to support additional analysis could be (but not 
limited to):
9
• Additional processing pipeline for the identification of common technologies 
introduced or employed.
• Additional processing pipeline for the identification of common models used across a 
field.
• Functionality allowing individual analysts to add curated metadata or data about 
papers in the data store for themselves and others to use.
The solution would need to be a facility to publicise analysis outputs, share common 
analysis pipelines, and to submit updates or new data. 
Additionally, the solution should consider ways of monitoring data usage, including query 
patterns and pipeline workloads, to be used for optimisation of the data store and different 
query types.

4 Assessments
4.1 Peer Assessment
Part of working in a team is the ability to provide feedback for each member of the team.
A regular peer assessment of all members of a group must be submitted by each individual
in the group. Please see the project timetable on Learn for an indication of when peer 
assessments will take place. In the weeks marked for peer assessment, a WebPA link will be 
provided in a Learn announcement together with the submission deadline.
PAs have an impact on each individual mark for the final group assessment, and their 
completion and quality have an impact on the individual professional conduct mark (see 
the Summative Criteria Individual: Professional Conduct marking scheme).
The first PA will be formative, an opportunity for you to try it out and receive feedback on it, 
however, following PA submission and quality will be marked as part of the Summative 
Criteria Individual: Professional Conduct.
PAs will involve rating each member of the group on four key questions. Importantly, you 
must rate yourself as well. Unsubstantiated ratings or coordinated efforts to negatively 
affect or manipulate this process will be treated as academic misconduct.
The questions will all ask you to give a person a rating from 0 (zero) to 5 (five):
Rating Assign when Justification
<2 Team member was mostly absent or 
caused issues in the group.
This must be supported by evidence and 
the group must have raised this issue with 
the Course Team at least 5 days before 
submission.
2
Team member contributed 
significantly less, and/or quality of 
work was significantly lower, and/or 
they acted in a less professional and 
collaborative manner.
This must be supported by evidence and 
specific examples of lower than standard 
quality work or behaviour must be given.
3
Team member had a satisfactory 
contribution. This is the default for 
someone who carries out their tasks 
and cooperates as much as other 
members.
This must be accompanied by specific 
examples of their work and how they 
contributed to the team.
>3
The team member contributed 
significantly more, and/or quality of 
work was significantly higher, and/or 
they acted in a more professional and 
collaborative manner.
This must be accompanied by specific 
examples of their work and how they 
contributed to the team, in particular how 
they exceeded standard contributions.

4.2 General submission format
The GitLab project your group is provided with will be the canonical source marked in the 
group assessment. 
Submission content should be in the repository, issue log and/or wiki of the project. All 
submissions as part of the group work should be in wiki/markdown format, or in a formal 
programming language.
Milestones 1 & 2 will be snapshots of your project. Other than your WebPA, you will not 
have to submit anything on these milestones. These will be taken from your group 
repositories by the course team.
The formative and final summative submissions must be submitted by each member of the 
group to the Assignment Submission tool (Turnitin).
Each member of the group should submit a text file of the following format to Turnitin:
Practical Software Development Assignment: ASSIGNMENT_NAME
Submission Owner: YOUR_NAME: YOUR_STUDENT_NUMBER
Group Members:
- GROUP_MEMBER: NUMBER
- GROUP_MEMBER: NUMBER
- GROUP_MEMBER: NUMBER
GitLab Project Link: GITLAB_PROJECT_LINK

4.3 Formative Group Assessment: Prototype review
In this assessment you are given an early prototype of the wanted system and a collection of 
hand-picked papers acting as data source. Your group will need to investigate and redesign 
this prototype, keeping in mind that the prototype is not optimised, it has not been tested 
and is not guaranteed to process all elements correctly.
In this assessment your group are expected to:
• Establish and document a code review process and group development standards
• Perform a group review to analyse the provided code and produce a summary of its 
functionality, defects and dependencies.
• Carry out testing to analyse any type of performance or correctness of the code.
• From the analysis, suggest improvements to the code.
The prototype is implemented in Python. It is expected that you may not be familiar with 
Python. A valuable programming skill is being able to use, read and profile code that is 
written in a language you have not encountered before, learning about the language as you 
go. A selection of resources can be found on Learn under Additional materials -> 
Programming Languages.
4.3.1 Submission Format
The submission to Turnitin should follow the General submission format.
4.3.2 Marking
Please note that this assessment will NOT count towards your final grade numerically. This 
assessment is to allow the course team to give feedback and advice on how to approach 
your learning in the course and the subsequent summative assessments. This initial 
assessment will be to provide a starting point for knowledge that you will need to build 
upon for the rest of the course.
You will receive formative feedback on the following:
• Performance and correctness of experimental design and documentation.
• Results and analysis visualisation.
• Quality of analysis.
• Conceptual understanding of the problem and code analysis.
• Quality of presentation.
13
4.4 Summative Group Presentation
In this assignment, your group will present your design and implementation plan to the 
client in a presentation. The presentation should highlight the technical merits of your 
design, how the team will be implementing the prioritised concept and how this matches 
the collected requirements. Think of your group as a software company and this
presentation as a pitch where you are trying to convince the client to invest in your 
proposal.
The presentation should include:
• Requirements gathering: what requirements have you collected and what features 
have you decided to develop for your prototype?
• Prototype ideas and design: what tools are you planning on using, how do you 
envision this would look like?
• Implementation plan: what requirements or feature are you going to implement in 
your prototype, what is an initial set of tasks, what development practices are you 
going to adopt, what and how are you going to document?
• Project management: how do you plan on approaching the implementation plan, 
main roles and assignments, initial project timeline?
Presentations will take place in front of the course assessment team and other audience 
members. This will be a verbal presentation, individuals unable to attend will be able to 
contribute via a hybrid online environment where necessary.
Presentations will be 15 minutes long, 10 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of 
questions.
4.4.1 Submission Format
The slides (PDF or PPTX) and any videos or live URLs should be added to the repository.
The submission to Turnitin should follow the General submission format.
4.4.2 Marking
Each section is marked out of 100 and then weighted as part of the final mark out of 100.
This assessment is 10% of the final course mark.
Visual elements 20%
Understanding and knowledge 20%
Content and coverage 20%
Presentation skills 20%
Group dynamics and participation 20%
14
4.5 Summative Group Assessment 
The summative group assessment will be assessed against three groups of criteria, each 
covering a specific area of the software development process. 
At each milestone snapshot, groups will be provided with feedback against these criteria 
and an indicative overall grade. This grade is an indication against the current status of the 
work only and should not be taken for granted.
4.5.1 Submission Format
The submission to Turnitin should follow the General submission format.
4.5.2 Summative Criteria Group: Design
The design criteria group should demonstrate the ability to investigate the problem and 
create a set of requirements or equivalent information for designing a solution. 
The final submission should include elements which cover:
• High-level design of an end-to-end solution
• Detailed design of the component(s) prioritised for a prototype
• Linking design to requirements
• Requirements including methodology choice, prioritisation and sourcing
• Language and Technology Choices – including alternatives considered
• Data Model for the designs
• Test Plan for Components
Please note that you can choose to build onto the prototype you reviewed in your 
Formative Group Assessment, or completely replace it with your own solution. For either 
approach, you can use the provided collection of hand-picked papers as a data source. If you 
wish to expand this, or add other data sources, please contact the Course Organisers to 
discuss potential legal and operational implications.
4.5.2.1 Marking
Requirements Engineering 30%
Language and Technology Choices 20%
Design, and Data Modelling 30%
Test Plans 20%

4.5.3 Summative Criteria Group: Planning
The planning criteria group should demonstrate the ability to carry out the planning and 
management aspects of a software development project.
The final submission should include elements which cover:
• A risk register and description of a risk management approach.
• Usability Cohort Design and Test Plan
• Project Management Approach
• Project Management Evidence
• Timeline including effort estimates and summaries
4.5.3.1 Marking
Risk Review 25%
Usability Cohort and Test Plan 25%
Project Management 25%
Task Management and Timeline 25%
16
4.5.4 Summative Criteria Group: Implementation 
The implementation criteria group should demonstrate the ability to produce, evaluate and 
document the outcomes of a software development project.
The final submission should include elements which cover:
• Working prototype:
o setup scripts 
o documentation
o code base
• Deployment of a CI/CD pipeline
• Usability Testing Summary and Analysis
• Software Testing Results and Analysis
• Project and prototype evaluation
• Coherent Documentation and Repository Use
While there is no enforced language or technology, the prototype should be submitted as a 
code base with setup scripts so that a tester can deploy the code, run a set of user tests and 
evaluate the product. The documentation should support the user through the first few 
actions after installation.
The usability testing could be done via pen/paper or mock-up interfaces or via an 
implementation. This should include how the test cohort was created, how it deviates from 
an ideal cohort and what the results of the testing mean.
The testing should examine elements of the prototype for how well it performs given 
different conditions and report back on this with limitations of the code base and 
suggestions of improvement.
The project and prototype evaluation should summarise and critique the whole group 
process (e.g., did you meet your plan, did you deviate, why?). This should include how the 
requirements were met, what effort was expended and how the team and prototype 
performed and what lessons can be learned.
4.5.4.1 Marking
Final Prototype (code, setup scripts, documentation) 30%
CI/CD Pipeline Design and Deployment 10%
Usability Analysis 15%
Testing Analysis 15%
Project and Prototype Evaluation 25%

4.5.5 Summative Criteria Individual: Professional Conduct
Each individual is marked for their professional conduct in their role as a Software 
Developer throughout the duration of the project. This looks at the following aspects:
• Use of version control and development tools
• Client communication
• Group representation in meetings
• Peer assessment submission and quality
4.5.5.1 Marking

4.6 Summative Personal Coursework
The personal coursework is split into two sections:
1. Code review (50%)
2. Personal reflection (50%)
Code review
Your group is expected to use code review practices throughout the development phase, 
this could include methods such as, but not limited to:
• Group code analysis
• Merge Requests
• Pair programming
Each individual should have had the opportunity to be both reviewer and reviewee by the 
time of the Personal Coursework submission. The code review should capture, from your 
personal perspective:
• A summary of the code review process(es) and project development standards
• Examples of what, when, why, and how the project review process(es) were applied, 
including your role and contribution
• A review of the outcomes and how they impacted the project
• Your opinion on the effectiveness of the project’s review process and development 
standards
This should be supported by evidence. Where the information is already detailed in other 
documents, it is sufficient to provide a summary in your own words and provide a link to the 
documentation.
The marking will take into account all of the above elements as well as the quality of your 
own contribution to the review process.
The code review should be started as soon as possible and should be a progressive exercise.
Personal reflection
A personal reflection on the group learning project. 
This should include a summary in your own words of what the project intended to achieve, 
what it did achieve, what you learned during the process, and a summary set of learning 
points moving forward.
The reflection piece should include:
19
• your opinion on the group performance and dynamics
• an assessment of your own work and contribution to the group’s performance and 
dynamics
• a measure of the project against its intended outcomes
• a summary of the concepts and learning that you have undertaken during the 
project
• a set of learning actions
4.6.1 Submission format
Since this is an individual assessment, each team member is expected to upload their own 
report directly to the assignment submission rather than via the repository. The report 
should be no more than 10 pages long (approx. 3500 words), Size 12 Text, 1.5 line spacing. -
excluding title pages, contents, glossary, and appendices. All statements, quotations and 
evidence provided must be referenced correctly. You may wish to refer to information given 
during your Project Preparation course for more information.
The report will be a submission template provided by the course assessment team. The 
submission format will be a PDF document.
4.6.2 Marking
Each section is marked out of 100 and then weighted as part of the final mark out of 100.
This assessment is 20% of the final course mark with modifications for peer assessment.
